{"name":"Minecraft-cambridge","tagline":"Info for Collusion Maker Challenge: http://www.collusion.org.uk/Maker-Challenge","body":"\r\n###Data used: \r\nLIDAR data from the Environment Agency available via data.gov.uk with \"Use limitation depending on license\". http://data.gov.uk/dataset/lidar-digital-surface-model.  Very straightforward process to get the data.\r\nThe map uses the 1m Digital Surface Map (DSM) and Digital Terrain Map (DTM)\r\nRoads paths and building data from OpenStreetMap http://www.openstreetmap.org/\r\n\r\n###Various Open Source tools\r\nQGIS to process the raw heightmap data \r\nMore QGIS to filter and rasterize the OpenStreetMap into various masks to try to identify buildings, roads, railways, water and trees (railway to follow) http://www2.qgis.org\r\nImageMagick to do some conversion on the exported map images (tif to png) http://www.imagemagick.org/\r\nPaint.NET to tidy up by hand the generated masks (I clearly could have done more here!) \r\nWorldPainter (with scripting) to create a terrain from the heightmap and masks http://worldpainter.net \r\nMCEdit - not used in the final version but could be used to improve the model - e.g. replace the tree height data with nice minecraft trees. http://www.mcedit.net/\r\n\r\n###Questions and Answers\r\nQ How big is the map?\r\nA The surface is 64 million square metres.  Each Minecraft block is a metre.\r\nIt corresponds to OS coordinates 542000,254000 : 550000,262000\r\n\r\nbut facing due North in Minecraft is a negative value so just stick a minus in front of the northing value and you should get to the right place. There are online tools to give eastings and northings from postcodes if you want to find a specific area.\r\n\r\nQ Why are some areas missing - just showing roads cut away?  \r\nA It's nothing personal - this is where LIDAR data wasn't available.  I think the roads are mapped at sea level so good for getting a feel for altitude of the terrain\r\n\r\nQ. Why are some buildings green or not there at all?\r\nA. The LIDAR data is up to a few years old so it is likely that the OpenStreetMap view is more up to date.  Alternatively the OSM data could be not accurate to the building edges.\r\n\r\nQ. Why are some edges of buildings missing?\r\nA. The building edges have been \"trimmed\" a bit to improve the definition of building edges.  You can build them back..\r\n\r\nQ. Can I get a copy of the Minecraft model?\r\nA. We're looking to make it available along with the recipe to build your own - just need to check licensing details.\r\n\r\nQ. Why aren't the bridges tunnelled through?\r\nA. Some things are best done in the game.  Improve an existing river crossing or create your own.\r\n\r\nQ. Why is the railway missing?\r\nA. It was next on the to do list.  Why not build your own transportation system? Underground?\r\n\r\nQ. What are the holes and bumps in the road?\r\nA. Probably not potholes.  Mostly Terrain changes or vehicles captured by the LIDAR.  The next version of the map will have half slabs to smoothen out the experience on foot.\r\n\r\n###Teleporting \r\nYou can teleport by typing /tp\r\n\r\nE.g. /tp 545548 80 -258140 should get you to virtual reality checkpoint.  80 is a height value so you'll be hovering above it.  I think 62 is sea level on our model.  The minecraft map can be 256 blocks high so plenty of room for building an underground transportation system or some skyscrapers..\r\n\r\n####Eastern Gate Opportunity Area \r\nPage 84 https://www.cambridge.gov.uk/public/ldf/draft_submission/Full%20Plan/Full%20Draft%20Plan%20with%20title%20pages%20reduced%20size.pdf\r\n```\r\n/tp 546174 80 -258858 (look towards Newmarket Road)\r\n```\r\n####Mill Road Opportunity Area\r\nPage 87 https://www.cambridge.gov.uk/public/ldf/draft_submission/Full%20Plan/Full%20Draft%20Plan%20with%20title%20pages%20reduced%20size.pdf\r\n```\r\n/tp 545809 80 -258177 (Petersfield, Donkey Common)\r\n/tp 546412 80 -257868 (Mill Road Depot)\r\n```\r\n####Mitcham's Corner Opportunity Area\r\nPage 80 https://www.cambridge.gov.uk/public/ldf/draft_submission/Full%20Plan/Full%20Draft%20Plan%20with%20title%20pages%20reduced%20size.pdf\r\n```\r\n/tp 545266 80 -259478  \r\n```\r\n\r\nExplore the spaces.\r\n\r\n####Sight seeing:\r\nKings Parade (check out the accidental green market stalls) \r\n```\r\n/tp 544810 80 -258393\r\n```\r\n###Minecraft controls - reminders\r\n\r\n\r\n####Time and weather\r\n```\r\n/time set 0     || Sets the time to dawn.\r\n/time set day   || Sets the time to 1000.\r\n/time set 6000  || Sets the time to midday\r\n/time set 12000 || Sets the time to dusk\r\n/time set night || Sets the time to 14000.\r\n/time set 18000 || Sets the time to midnight\r\n\r\n/gamerule doDaylightCycle [true/false]\r\n\r\n/weather clear <time>, /weather rain <time>, or /weather thunder <time> \r\n```\r\nNote that <time> is the number of seconds that the weather will take place.\r\n\r\n####Flying\r\nFlying mode can be toggled by double-tapping space. The player can gain or lose altitude while flying by pressing \"space\" or \"shift\" keys, respectively. Holding \"control\" allows you to move faster while flying.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
